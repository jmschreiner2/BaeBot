# BaeBot

This bot code hasn't been updated in a while and is largely deprecated. This was replaced by [Baebot-rs](https://github.com/jmschreiner2/baebot-rs)

This is a simple discord bot that uses various image board APIs and allows a user to query a random image with tags.

I wrote this for my friend's private discord to give us a fun way to find different fan art of our favorite characters.

# Quickstart

To get this app running, you will need discord bot tokens which you can get from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2).

You can add those tokens to config.json.

Then run `npm start` to run the bot. 

OR 

```
docker build . -t baebot:latest
```
to build a docker image.
